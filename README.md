# fakebook
Fakebook is a Facebook clone, built using React.js, Django, Postgresql. It has the basic capabilities of a social media app with the exception of posting media. This full stack application is created to apply skills learnt in Python programming language, and Django's ORM.

## Setup
1. `npm i` for frontend
2. `python manage.py runserver` for backend
3. Here is a working live version of the frontend application: [Fakebook](https://mango-fakebook.netlify.app/)

## Stack
1. React.js
2. Django - Django REST Framework, Simple-jwt, django-cors-headers, psycopg2
3. Postgresql via psycopg2 and Django ORMs

## Project Status
Completed. Might implement additional features like posting media.

## Trivia
This app is created for project 4 of GA SEI-33. Large part of the reason why stems from curiousity about how friends system in social media apps work.
